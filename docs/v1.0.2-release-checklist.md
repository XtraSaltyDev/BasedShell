## Manual Checks (Run on packaged app)

Mark each item as PASS/FAIL and add evidence notes.

1. Install and first launch

- [ ] Confirm app opens and remains stable.
Notes:

2. Core session behavior

Notes:

3. Split panes

Notes:

4. Settings and themes

- [ ] All Catppuccin flavors visible and selectable:
  - [ ] Latte
  - [ ] Frappe

Notes:

5. Keyboard shortcuts
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+K` toggles command palette.
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+K` clears terminal.
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+F` opens search.
- [ ] `Cmd/Ctrl+,` opens settings.
Notes:

6. Update flow (unsigned)
- [ ] `Check for Updates` does not crash.

- [ ] `Open Latest Release Downloads` opens GitHub releases page.
Notes:

7. Window and interaction polish
- [ ] Window drag works without needing focus reset.
- [ ] No double borders or pane fill gaps after split/resize.
- [ ] Status HUD reflects active pane context.
