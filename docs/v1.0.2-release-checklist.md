# v1.0.2 Release Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate release quality before tagging `v1.0.2`.

## Scope

- Product: BasedShell (macOS, unsigned community build path)
- Branch target: `main`
- Validation owner: maintainers
- Candidate app version: `1.0.1`

## Automated Checks (Completed)

Run date: 2026-02-19

1. `npm run build`  
Status: PASS
2. `node --test test/*.cjs`  
Status: PASS (9 passed, 0 failed)

## Manual Checks (Run on packaged app)

Status legend: `[PASS]`, `[FAIL]`, `[PENDING]`, `[N/A]`, `[PASS-WORKAROUND]`  
Mandatory item marker: `[M]`

Mark each item with a status and add evidence notes.

1. Install and first launch
- [M][PASS] Install from latest DMG into `/Applications`.
- [M][PASS-WORKAROUND] Launch via right-click `Open` (may fail for unsigned build; workaround validated).
- [M][PASS] If blocked, run:
  - `sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BasedShell.app`
  - `open /Applications/BasedShell.app`
- [M][PASS] Confirm app opens and remains stable.
Notes:

2. Core session behavior
- [M][PASS] Startup opens clean prompt at `~` (no broken init output).
- [M][PASS] New tab creates a session successfully.

- [M][PENDING] `Open Latest Release Downloads` opens GitHub releases page.
Notes:
